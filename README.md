# Pygame_Shape_Game
A game written with pygame where you jump around avoiding enemies
It's not completely finished, but it's close enough to post.

I wanted to learn about pygame to compare it with tkinter and while I probably won't go into game development, it's a really exciting and entertaining way to build up my programming skills.

This was my first game written in pygame (and pretty much my first game ever). The majority of this code was written with trial and error so there are a lot of mistakes that I know about and that I don't. Eventually I want to be able to go back and fix all of them, but for now this was the best I could do (after I finish up some last things).

I tried following the standards that I knew including certain variable_naming_conventions and made sure to comment my code. (Although I added way too many where I didn't need to and not enough where I did). 

All of the sounds currently in the game where quick things I made mainly as place-holders. To be honest they get annoying, but I was curious how to add sounds and it turned out to be fairly easy.

I did first see pygame in a youtube video from Scriptline Studios called "Pygame Top Down Shooter Tutorial #1 - Player Setup" which was a really amazing video that I need to watch more closely.

```
RULES:\
Move and jump with 'w, a, d.' You can triple jump as long as you have enough jump strength left (indicated with the light reen bar).\
Avoid the green enemies they take health. Three hits and you lose.\
The red blocks are health boosts: they heal you but not more then 1 over your max health. You start with 3 health.\
The blue blocks speed you up temporarily and the white ones shrink you temporarily.\
The higher up you are the more points you earn! The goal is to get the most points as fast as possible!
```
